2. **Specify exact quality check phrases** used in the data
3. **Prioritize common object types** in the prompt structure
4. **Use correct field format** (`"extra question:"` not `"extra:"`)

### Updated Object Type Categories
```
1. BBU Equipment: huawei bbu, zte bbu, ericsson bbu
2. Cabinet Status: cabinet fully occupied, cabinet not fully occupied  
3. Installation: install screw correct, install screw incorrect, floor screw installed
4. Connections: cpri connection correct, cpri connection incorrect, odf connection correct
5. Cables: fiber cable, non-fiber cable
6. Shields: bbu shield installed, bbu shield not installed
7. Labels: label matches, label does not match
8. Grounding: cabinet grounding correct, cabinet grounding incorrect
```

### Updated Quality Checks
```
- Fiber cables: "fibre bend radius proper, snake tube protection" / "fibre bend radius proper, armour protection" / "fibre bend radius proper, no snake tube or armour protection"
- Shields: "shield orientation correct, shield orientation correct, shield unobstructed"
- Cables: "binding aligned horizontally and vertically"
- Labels: "match" / "not match"
- Screws: "not tightened"
```

## Recommendations

### For Training
1. **Focus on rare cases**: Include examples with incorrect installations and rare equipment types
2. **Balance complexity**: Ensure training data includes sparse, medium, and dense samples
3. **Quality check emphasis**: Train on specific quality check phrases found in the data

### For Evaluation
1. **Monitor rare object types**: Pay special attention to Ericsson BBU and error cases
2. **Quality check accuracy**: Evaluate model's ability to use exact quality check phrases
3. **Complex scene handling**: Test performance on dense samples (>15 objects)

### For Data Collection
1. **Increase rare equipment**: Collect more Ericsson BBU and error case examples
2. **Error case documentation**: Document more incorrect installation examples
3. **Quality check standardization**: Ensure consistent quality check phrase usage

This analysis provides the foundation for accurate system prompts and effective model training on telecommunications equipment quality inspection tasks.
